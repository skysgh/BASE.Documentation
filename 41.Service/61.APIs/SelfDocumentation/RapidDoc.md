# Synopsis #

RapidDoc is less known than ReDoc or Swagger UI -- but has a lot going for it.

Although According to some it doesn't have try me (but that was back in 2020). 
Have to investigate it to see if that has been added since.

Correction: Looks like it has.

And it allows configuring responding from multiple servers too!

It also can't do what Swagger can do in that it cannot point to multiple specs from one one file (to be checked/worked around).


## Development Perspective ##

The documentation available here shows it's easily extensible.

### As a Nuget Package ###

It's not officially maintained, but ...

The following Nuget package has done the hard work of integrating it.
