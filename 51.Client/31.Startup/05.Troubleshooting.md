## Synopsis ##

It could. It should. But it doesn't... Now what?


## Development Perspective ##


### Doesn't Start


### Starts (see a UX...but can't invoke server for a while)

Sounds like the Client is starting up before the Server.

* In visual Studio
* In SOlution Explorer
* Right click the Solution Node
* Select "Set Startup Projects"
* Ensure that they are setup as per [Configuration instructions](./03.Configuration.md), such that
  * 2 Projects are set to Start, and
  * The Server is higher/starts earlier than the Client


### Starts (see a UX...but can't invoke server)

If the UX comes up, but invoking services doesn't do much:

* Maybe it's only temporary (the client started before the server), see above, or
* The client server is not proxying to the service server:

```
[webpack-dev-server] [HPM] Error occurred while proxying request localhost:4201/api/rest/xyz to https://localhost:8201/ [ECONNREFUSED]
```
In which case we have to cehck if the server is actually up first 
by invoking `https://localhost:8201/` in a browser 
and see if anything response.

If the error is `HTTP ERROR 404` then maybe try 
`https://localhost:8201/swagger`



If the error is `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` then maybe it's ...dunno.
I do know there were two clients side by side and both were set to start
at startup...and that was tied to the error, as once I unloaded the second
angular UI from the solution, things started to work again.
