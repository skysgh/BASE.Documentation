## Synopsis ##


## Process ##


### First Page ###
After the [Server](./server.md) has started, 
it invokes the first page to show in it.

This is defined in the `angular.json` file:


```cs
{
  "projects": {
    "App.Base.Client.Web": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "index": "src/index2.html"
...
```




### Index Page ###

The Single Page index page looks like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  ...
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
</body>
</html>
```

Note:
It is important to recognise that even if the filename is an html 
file (and not a component template), it is still going to be 
played with by Angular as if it were a template.

ie: By the time Angular has picked it up, messed with it, packaged it,
it's going to look different, having been injected with 
a link to include the angular framework JS file, 
as well as a line at the bottom:

```html
<script src="main.js" type="module"></script>
```

that invoke s
  the first source code file which it knows -- from `angular.json` -- 
  as being the product of `main.ts`:

```js
...
"main": "src/main.ts"
...
```

Note that the index template contains an Angular tag (`app-root`)
which we'll come back to later:

```html
  <app-root>Loading...</app-root>
```




### Main.ts ###

So Index causes `main.ts` to load:

```ts
// in main.ts: 
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```
which in thrn invokes the logical package/Module.

### app.module.ts ###

The module is a logical construct which 
imports the `AppComponent` *and*
declares it as the Bootstrap component:

```ts
...
@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
which in turn imports the module's 
'first component...

### App.Component ###

Which defines the tag it is to expand into (`app-root`)
```cs
...
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: '<b>Bootstrapping an Angular Application</b>'
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

Which, as we showed before, is in the `index.html`:

```cs
<body>
    <app-root>Loading...</app-root>
</body>
```

So that's how the contents of app.component get loaded into view...
