ORM are there to solve Object Persistence: Objects are first-class citizens, not database tables.

So it's appropriate to provide a Many-To-Many relationship transparently by relying on a database Junction Table.

That is until you need to add a Property, or Behavior -- in which case you will need more than a Junction Table.
