## Synopsis ##



## Background ##

Visual Studio comes with a couple of simple Angular Templates.
Some rely on Bootstrap. Others do not.
If you move things around, you may have to 

* Install Bootstrap
* Refer to Bootstrap package contents from the Angular config so 
  that it gets packaged up.


## Development Perspective ##

If you have imported angular files and actually got them up and running, 
but styles are not showing up, consider the following fix:


### Installing Bootstrap ###

* `package.json` is the config file for `npm`
* If bootstrap is not listed under dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@angular/...
    ...
    "bootstrap": "^5.2.2",
    ...
  },
```
Then it won't be available in the `node_modules` directory (which might be
excluded/hidden from the Visual Studio project in Solution Explorer).
To fix

* In Solution Explorer
* Right click the the Angular client project
* select "Open in Terminal"
* `npm bootstrap` will download the package.

But the project will still ignore it until told otherwise.

* Open `angular.json`
* Add references to bootstrap's `css` and `js` files as follows:

```json
 "projects": {
    "App.Client.Web": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.css"
            ],
            "scripts": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
            ]
          },
...
```

Note that when done this way angular is in charge of bundling
what it needs. It also is in charge of injecting references to the 
above files into the app's index template, so you don't have to do
anything else.
